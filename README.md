# LeetCode Daily Growth ðŸš€  

## About This Repository  
This repository is my personal **daily journal** of solving LeetCode problems. 
The goal is not just to find solutions but to **understand problems deeply**, explore multiple approaches, and refine them for **optimal time complexity**.  

Each problem is documented with:  
- **A simple explanation** in my own words.  
- **My thought process** before jumping to solutions.  
- **Multiple solutions**, from brute-force to the most efficient.  
- **Time complexity analysis** and lessons learned.


ðŸ“Œ## Why This Journal?  

I could just write solutions, but **writing forces clarity**. This is an attempt to **build strong problem-solving skills**, improve efficiency, and make sense of complex problems in a simple way.  

The journey is long, but **growth happens daily.**  
ðŸ”¥ Letâ€™s Do This!
